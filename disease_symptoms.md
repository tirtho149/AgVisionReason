## Mango Leaf Diseases

### Anthracnose

**Symptoms:**
Anthracnose on mango leaves appears as dark brown to black FLAT SUNKEN spots or lesions that look like they are embedded INTO the leaf tissue (not sitting on top like sooty mould, not raised like gall midge). The lesions are irregular or oval shaped, often with a lighter tan/brown center and darker brown-black edges. A key feature is that lesions may have HOLES where dead tissue has fallen out, and leaf edges often look torn or eaten away where lesions reached the margin. On tan/brown colored leaves, anthracnose shows as darker patches with visible water-drop-like blistering or warty texture on the surface. Severely affected leaves turn mostly brown/tan with the green midrib still visible. KEY DIFFERENCE FROM OTHER DISEASES: Anthracnose produces flat sunken lesions embedded in the leaf (not raised bumps like Gall Midge), with holes and eaten-away margins (not a coating like Sooty Mould), and affects scattered areas of the leaf (not progressive tip-to-base browning like Die Back).

### Bacterial Canker

**Symptoms:**
Bacterial canker on mango leaves initially appears as small water-soaked spots (1-3 mm in diameter) that enlarge into raised, black, angular lesions limited by leaf veins and surrounded by a prominent chlorotic (yellow) halo. The angular shape constrained by venation is a key distinguishing feature, giving the spots a geometric rather than rounded appearance. As the disease progresses, individual lesions may coalesce into large necrotic patches, and a greasy or oily margin is often visible around active lesions, especially in humid conditions. In severe infections, bacterial ooze may be observed exuding from the lesions, and affected leaves show extensive yellowing before dropping prematurely. The raised, dark appearance of spots combined with the characteristic yellow halo and angular shape distinguishes bacterial canker from fungal leaf spots.

### Cutting Weevil

**Symptoms:**
Cutting weevil damage on mango leaves is identified by brown, curled, and crumpled young leaves caused by adult weevils scraping the surface layers of tender pinkish new flush. The female weevil excavates small cavities on either side of the midrib on the lower surface, then cuts the leaf near its base, causing partially severed or completely detached leaves to hang or fall to the ground. The most obvious visual sign is the presence of cut leaf pieces beneath the tree and stripped, leafless shoots visible from a distance. Affected leaves show "windowpane" damage between the veins where the surface tissue has been scraped away, leaving translucent patches. Unlike disease-caused damage, cutting weevil produces mechanical injury patterns—torn edges, irregular cuts near the petiole, and contorted or twisted leaf shapes rather than spots, lesions, or discoloration.

### Die Back

**Symptoms:**
Die back disease on mango leaves is recognized by the progressive darkening, wilting, and drying of leaves starting from the tips of twigs and extending inward toward the main branches. Affected leaves show browning of veins followed by upward curling, withering, and eventual drop from the tree, often leaving bare, defoliated branches. The bark on affected twigs and branches becomes discolored, turning darker than healthy tissue, and in advanced stages, gummy exudation (gumming) appears as small droplets on twigs that may increase to cover entire branches. The disease typically shows a gradient pattern—leaves at the branch tips are completely dead and dry while those closer to the trunk may still show partial green with progressive browning. The combination of twig dieback with darkened bark, leaf curling, defoliation, and gum secretion on the same branch is the key visual identifier that distinguishes die back from other mango leaf diseases.

### Gall Midge

**Symptoms:**
Gall midge damage on mango leaves produces distinctive RAISED, 3D BUMP-LIKE GALLS that protrude visibly from the leaf surface — these are NOT flat spots or discoloration. Each gall is a small dome or cone shape (2-3 mm) that casts a shadow and has clear depth/height when viewed from the side. The galls are sparsely scattered on an otherwise GREEN and HEALTHY-looking leaf — the leaf background remains green, not darkened or coated. Galls may be reddish-brown or dark brown. As galls mature, exit holes appear creating "shot holes" in the leaf. KEY DIFFERENCE FROM OTHER DISEASES: Gall midge galls are raised 3D bumps on a green leaf, NOT flat dark spots (Sooty Mould), NOT sunken lesions (Anthracnose), and NOT angular spots with yellow halos (Bacterial Canker).

### Powdery Mildew

**Symptoms:**
Powdery mildew on mango leaves appears as a characteristic white or grayish powdery fungal growth that typically begins on the underside of young leaves and spreads to cover both surfaces. The infection starts as small scattered patches of white powdery mycelium that expand and coalesce to cover large areas, and on very susceptible cultivars, youngest leaves may become completely coated with fungal spores. When the white powdery growth weathers away or is disturbed, the underlying tissue reveals purple-brown to brownish blotches, which is a key diagnostic feature on older infected leaves. Affected leaves often curl downward and become distorted, with grey necrotic lesions developing on the upper leaf surface, and in severe cases leaves turn completely brown and dry before dropping. The distinctive floury white coating that can be rubbed off to reveal discolored tissue beneath is the primary visual identifier separating powdery mildew from other mango leaf diseases.

### Sooty Mould

**Symptoms:**
Sooty mould on mango leaves appears as a SUPERFICIAL dark coating or film that sits ON TOP of the leaf surface, like soot or dust was sprinkled on it. It can appear as numerous tiny dark speckles densely scattered across the leaf giving a "dirty" or "dusty" look, OR as larger dark smudgy patches that merge together. The key visual feature is that the dark material looks like it's SITTING ON the leaf surface (not embedded in the tissue) — the leaf underneath is still green. The spots/coating are FLAT (not raised like gall midge bumps) and do NOT have yellow halos (unlike bacterial canker). The overall impression is of a leaf that looks unwashed or sooty. KEY DIFFERENCE FROM OTHER DISEASES: Sooty mould produces a superficial dirty/dusty coating of many tiny dark speckles or smudges on a green leaf, NOT raised bumps (Gall Midge), NOT distinct lesions with halos (Bacterial Canker/Anthracnose), and NOT large necrotic brown patches (Die Back).

## Yellow Rust Severity in Wheat

### MRMS

**Symptoms:**
In the MRMS (Moderate to Moderately Susceptible) severity level of yellow rust on wheat, rust pustules appear moderately dense but somewhat scattered, covering approximately 10-25% of the leaf surface. The pustules exhibit a noticeable yellow-orange color, though not as intense or widespread as in higher severity levels. Leaf health is moderately compromised, with some chlorosis around pustules, but overall leaf structure remains largely intact. This level is differentiated from higher severity levels by the less extensive pustule coverage and more intact leaf vitality, while being more developed and visually discernible than lower severity levels, which have fewer pustules and less discoloration.

### Moderately Resistant MR

**Symptoms:**
In the "Moderately Resistant MR" severity level of yellow rust on wheat plants, the rust pustules are scattered and less dense compared to more susceptible levels, with a distinct yet moderate presence of yellow to orange color. These pustules typically cover about 10-25% of the leaf surface. Despite the presence of pustules, the overall leaf health remains relatively robust, with minimal signs of desiccation or broader discoloration. This severity level is characterized by noticeable pustule distribution, yet it is significantly less extensive than that observed in fully susceptible plants, where pustules are densely clustered and cover a much larger area of the leaf.

### Moderately Susceptible MS

**Symptoms:**
In the "Moderately Susceptible MS" severity level of yellow rust on wheat plants, rust pustules are moderately dense, scattered but covering about 15-25% of the leaf surface. The pustules exhibit a prominent yellow-orange color, indicating active sporulation. Leaves are visibly stressed, showing signs of chlorosis around pustule sites, but retain some green areas indicative of partial resistance. This severity level is distinct from others by having a more substantial pustule coverage and color intensity than less severe levels, yet less extensive than the higher severity levels where lesions might coalesce, leading to more pronounced leaf damage.

### Resistant R

**Symptoms:**
At the "Resistant R" severity level of yellow rust on wheat, rust pustules are sparse and isolated, with very few visible pustules scattered lightly across the leaf surface, covering less than 1% of the leaf. The color of the pustules is a pale yellow that is less intense than in more severe infections. The rest of the leaf remains vibrant green, with no signs of chlorosis or necrosis. This severity level differs from others by the minimal presence of pustules and overall healthy leaf appearance, indicating effective resistance.

### Susceptible S

**Symptoms:**
In the "Susceptible S" severity level of yellow rust on wheat plants, the leaf surfaces exhibit abundant and densely packed pustules of bright yellow or orange color. The pustules cover approximately 25% to 50% of the leaf surface, significantly more than in lower severity levels. The leaf displays signs of distress with visible chlorosis or necrosis around the pustules. This level is distinguished by its high concentration and spread of pustules compared to resistant or moderately infected categories, showing extensive coverage and more uniform intensity across infected areas.
