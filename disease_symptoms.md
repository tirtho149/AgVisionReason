## Mango Leaf Diseases

### Anthracnose

**Symptoms:**
Anthracnose on mango tree leaves is characterized by dark brown to black irregularly shaped lesions, often forming along the veins. The spots may coalesce to cover larger areas, and lesions typically have a water-soaked appearance leading to necrotic tissue as they mature. Leaves often exhibit a distinct yellow halo surrounding the lesions. Over time, the affected areas may become dry and brittle, giving a slightly sunken texture. These features help distinguish anthracnose from other foliar diseases in mango.

### Bacterial Canker

**Symptoms:**
Bacterial canker on mango tree leaves manifests as irregular, small, dark brown to black water-soaked lesions surrounded by a yellow halo. These lesions often become necrotic with time, giving the leaf a scorched appearance. The spots may be angular or circular and are typically scattered randomly or along the leaf veins. A greasy or oily texture can sometimes be observed on the leaf surface, particularly in humid conditions, which helps differentiate it from fungal diseases.

### Cutting Weevil

**Symptoms:**
Cutting Weevil damage on mango tree leaves is characterized by distinct, semicircular notches or cuts along the leaf edges, which are a result of adult weevils feeding. The notches give the leaves a scalloped appearance. Unlike other diseases, this mechanical damage does not involve discoloration, lesions, or texture changes like wilting or necrosis. The uniformity of the cuts and their location along the outer perimeter is a unique identifier distinguishing it from other foliar diseases.

### Die Back

**Symptoms:**
Die Back disease on mango tree leaves is characterized by initial leaf tip necrosis that progresses along the midrib. The affected areas exhibit dark brown, irregular patches with clearly defined margins. Surrounding tissue may display varying shades of yellow or bronze, creating a distinct contrast against healthy green foliage. The leaves may become dry and brittle, with noticeable curling or bending downwards. Unique identifiers include the consistent progression from the tips downwards and the coexistence of stem dieback on the same branches.

### Gall Midge

**Symptoms:**
Gall Midge disease on mango tree leaves is characterized by small, reddish to brownish galls forming on the underside of leaves, often near midribs. These galls are initially smooth but may become rough and textured as they mature. The galls typically appear in clusters, causing the leaves to exhibit slight upward curling or crinkling. Unlike other diseases, the presence of these distinct, clustered galls with a reddish hue is a unique symptom, key for identification by a machine learning model.

### Powdery Mildew

**Symptoms:**
Powdery mildew on mango tree leaves is characterized by a distinctive white or grayish powdery coating that primarily appears on the upper surface of young leaves. This fungal growth starts as small, circular patches that can expand and coalesce, often giving the leaf a mottled appearance. Affected areas may display some leaf curling or distortion and the underlying tissue can yellow slightly. The powdery texture is a key identifier, distinguishing it from other fungal diseases that produce more visible lesions or wet, untreated spots.

### Sooty Mould

**Symptoms:**
Sooty mold on mango tree leaves manifests as a superficial, black, sooty coating or film covering the upper leaf surfaces. The mold appears in irregular patches, often forming a continuous layer but not penetrating the leaf tissue itself. The texture is generally dry and powdery, easily scraped off with a fingernail. It is distinctively associated with honeydew secretions from sap-sucking insects like aphids or scales, which can help differentiate it from diseases causing intrinsic leaf damage or necrosis.

## Yellow Rust Severity in Wheat

### MRMS

**Symptoms:**
In the MRMS (Moderate to Moderately Susceptible) severity level of yellow rust on wheat, rust pustules appear moderately dense but somewhat scattered, covering approximately 10-25% of the leaf surface. The pustules exhibit a noticeable yellow-orange color, though not as intense or widespread as in higher severity levels. Leaf health is moderately compromised, with some chlorosis around pustules, but overall leaf structure remains largely intact. This level is differentiated from higher severity levels by the less extensive pustule coverage and more intact leaf vitality, while being more developed and visually discernible than lower severity levels, which have fewer pustules and less discoloration.

### Moderately Resistant MR

**Symptoms:**
In the "Moderately Resistant MR" severity level of yellow rust on wheat plants, the rust pustules are scattered and less dense compared to more susceptible levels, with a distinct yet moderate presence of yellow to orange color. These pustules typically cover about 10-25% of the leaf surface. Despite the presence of pustules, the overall leaf health remains relatively robust, with minimal signs of desiccation or broader discoloration. This severity level is characterized by noticeable pustule distribution, yet it is significantly less extensive than that observed in fully susceptible plants, where pustules are densely clustered and cover a much larger area of the leaf.

### Moderately Susceptible MS

**Symptoms:**
In the "Moderately Susceptible MS" severity level of yellow rust on wheat plants, rust pustules are moderately dense, scattered but covering about 15-25% of the leaf surface. The pustules exhibit a prominent yellow-orange color, indicating active sporulation. Leaves are visibly stressed, showing signs of chlorosis around pustule sites, but retain some green areas indicative of partial resistance. This severity level is distinct from others by having a more substantial pustule coverage and color intensity than less severe levels, yet less extensive than the higher severity levels where lesions might coalesce, leading to more pronounced leaf damage.

### Resistant R

**Symptoms:**
At the "Resistant R" severity level of yellow rust on wheat, rust pustules are sparse and isolated, with very few visible pustules scattered lightly across the leaf surface, covering less than 1% of the leaf. The color of the pustules is a pale yellow that is less intense than in more severe infections. The rest of the leaf remains vibrant green, with no signs of chlorosis or necrosis. This severity level differs from others by the minimal presence of pustules and overall healthy leaf appearance, indicating effective resistance.

### Susceptible S

**Symptoms:**
In the "Susceptible S" severity level of yellow rust on wheat plants, the leaf surfaces exhibit abundant and densely packed pustules of bright yellow or orange color. The pustules cover approximately 25% to 50% of the leaf surface, significantly more than in lower severity levels. The leaf displays signs of distress with visible chlorosis or necrosis around the pustules. This level is distinguished by its high concentration and spread of pustules compared to resistant or moderately infected categories, showing extensive coverage and more uniform intensity across infected areas.
