  "reasoning": "Perfect! I can now see the test image and have the knowledge base. Let me analyze the image:\n\n**Visual Analysis of test_001.jpg:**\n\nThe image shows a wheat leaf with yellow rust infection. Key observations:\n\n1. **Pustule Distribution**: The rust pustules are moderately spread across the leaf surface, appearing as yellow-orange streaks and spots\n2. **Coverage**: The affected area appears to cover approximately 15-25% of the leaf surface\n3. **Pustule Color**: The pustules display a prominent yellow-orange color, indicating active sporulation\n4. **Leaf Health**: The leaf shows visible stress with some chlorosis (yellowing) around the pustule sites, but significant green areas remain intact\n5. **Pustule Density**: The pustules are scattered but not densely packed - they appear moderately concentrated\n\n**Comparison to Knowledge Base Severity Levels:**\n\n- **Resistant_R**: Only <1% coverage, sparse pustules - \u274c No, our image has much more coverage\n- **Moderately_Resistant_MR**: 10-25% coverage, scattered pustules, minimal discoloration - \u26a0\ufe0f Possible, but our image shows more prominent yellow-orange coloring\n- **MRMS**: 10-25% coverage, moderately dense, some chlorosis - \u2713 Good match\n- **Moderately_Susceptible_MS**: 15-25% coverage, moderately dense, prominent yellow-orange, visible chlorosis - \u2713 Strong match\n- **Susceptible_S**: 25-50% coverage, densely packed, abundant pustules - \u274c No, our image has less coverage\n\nThe image most closely matches the **Moderately_Susceptible_MS** category because:\n- The pustules are moderately dense and scattered (not sparse like MR, not densely packed like S)\n- The coverage appears to be in the 15-25% range\n- The pustules display prominent yellow-orange coloring with active sporulation\n- Visible chlorosis is present around pustule sites\n- The leaf retains some green areas indicating partial resistance\n\n```json\n{\"prediction\": \"Moderately_Susceptible_MS\"}\n```",
