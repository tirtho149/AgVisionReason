  "reasoning": "Perfect! Now I have all the reference images and the target image. Let me analyze the classification:\n\n## Analysis of test_002.jpg\n\n**Target Image Characteristics:**\n- Predominantly yellowish-green leaf appearance\n- Sparse to moderate distribution of rust pustules\n- Pustules visible but not densely packed\n- Overall leaf structure appears largely intact\n- Some areas of discoloration but maintaining significant green coloring\n\n**Comparison with Reference Images:**\n\n1. **Resistant_R** (Resistant_R_001.jpg): Shows a leaf with only 1-2 very small orange pustules on an otherwise vibrant green leaf. The target image has noticeably MORE pustules and more discoloration than this.\n\n2. **Moderately_Resistant_MR** (Moderately_Resistant_MR_001.jpg): Shows scattered pustules with moderate presence, some brownish spots visible. The leaf is predominantly green with minimal chlorosis. The target has more visible discoloration/yellowing overall.\n\n3. **MRMS** (MRMS_001.jpg): Shows moderate coverage with numerous scattered rust pustules covering a larger area with visible yellow-orange coloration and some striping patterns. The target image appears similar in pustule density.\n\n4. **Moderately_Susceptible_MS** (Moderately_Susceptible_MS_001.jpg): Shows denser pustule coverage with prominent yellow-orange coloring throughout, more extensive than MRMS. The target appears less densely infected than this.\n\n5. **Susceptible_S** (Susceptible_S_001.jpg): Shows very dense, abundant pustules with extensive orange-yellow coverage across most of the leaf surface. The target is clearly not this severe.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe target image (test_002.jpg) shows moderate pustule coverage with scattered but noticeable rust infections. Comparing the visual characteristics, the pustule density and coverage pattern most closely matches the **MRMS** (Moderate to Moderately Susceptible) category, with approximately 10-25% leaf surface coverage and moderate chlorosis around pustule sites.\n\n```json\n{\"prediction\": \"MRMS\"}\n```",
