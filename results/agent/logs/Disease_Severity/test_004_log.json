Let me analyze the target image (test_004.jpg) against these references:\n\n## Analysis:\n\n**Target Image (test_004.jpg) Characteristics:**\n- Yellow-orange pustules scattered across the leaf\n- Moderate density of pustules - clearly visible but not densely packed\n- Pustules appear to cover approximately 15-20% of the leaf surface\n- Leaf retains some green color but shows significant yellowing/chlorosis\n- Pustules appear somewhat linear/streaky along the leaf length\n\n**Reference Comparisons:**\n\n1. **Moderately_Resistant_MR_001**: Very sparse pustules, minimal discoloration, mostly healthy green leaf. Does NOT match test_004.\n\n2. **MRMS_001**: Moderately dense, scattered pustules covering approximately 10-25% of leaf surface. Yellow-orange color, some chlorosis around pustules. **This matches test_004 closely** - similar density and coverage.\n\n3. **Moderately_Susceptible_MS_001**: Similar to MRMS but slightly denser pustule coverage. Also a strong candidate, but pustules appear more uniformly distributed.\n\n4. **Susceptible_S_001**: Much denser pustule coverage (25-50%), more pronounced yellowing/necrosis across the entire leaf area. Does NOT match test_004 - too severe.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing test_004 to these references, the pustule density and coverage (approximately 15-20%) most closely aligns with **MRMS** (Moderate to Moderately Susceptible). The pustules are moderately scattered, show the characteristic yellow-orange color with some chlorosis, and the leaf retains partial integrity - exactly matching the MRMS symptom description.\n\n```json\n{\"prediction\": \"MRMS\"}\n```",
