This is a strong match.\n\n2. **Gall Midge Reference (Gall_Midge_001)** - Shows raised, 3D bumps on a green leaf. This does NOT match the target, which has flat lesions on a tan leaf.\n\n3. **Sooty Mould Reference (Sooty_Mould_002)** - Shows many tiny dark speckles on a mostly green leaf. While there are many spots, they appear more superficial and dust-like, and the leaf background is greener than in the target image.\n\n**Key Diagnostic Features of Target Image:**\n- Lesions are EMBEDDED/SUNKEN (not raised like gall midge)\n- Leaf is tan/brown (typical for advanced anthracnose)\n- Dark-edged spots with lighter centers (typical anthracnose pattern)\n- Scattered distribution across the leaf\n- Multiple lesions indicating disease progression\n\nThe target image most closely matches **Anthracnose** based on the sunken lesions with darker edges, lighter centers, scattered distribution, and the tan-colored leaf with visible green midrib.\n\n```json\n{\"prediction\": \"Anthracnose\"}\n```",
