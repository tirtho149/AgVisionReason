This perfectly aligns with the knowledge base description of \"numerous tiny dark speckles densely scattered across the leaf giving a dirty or dusty look.\"\n\n2. **Gall Midge** (Ruled Out): Reference images show distinct raised bumps/galls that are 3D and clearly protrude from the leaf surface. The target image lacks this 3D bump appearance - the spots are flat and superficial.\n\n3. **Anthracnose** (Ruled Out): Reference images show dark brown lesions with distinct borders, some with holes and damaged leaf margins. The target image shows evenly scattered speckles without the characteristic lesion structure or tissue damage.\n\nThe dark speckles in test_010.jpg are superficial (sitting on top of the green leaf) rather than embedded or raised, which definitively points to **Sooty Mould**.\n\n```json\n{\"prediction\": \"Sooty_Mould\"}\n```",
