The leaf appears to have multiple small to medium-sized dark lesions scattered across the surface. Let me now view reference images for the top candidate classes to compare.\n\nThe visual features I observe in test_010.jpg:\n- Multiple dark brown/black lesions scattered across the leaf surface\n- The lesions appear relatively small to medium-sized\n- Distributed pattern across the leaf\n- Appears to have some yellow/greenish coloring around affected areas\n- The overall leaf color is light green with spots\n\nBased on the symptom descriptions, my top candidates are:\n1. **Anthracnose** - dark brown to black lesions, water-soaked appearance, yellow halo\n2. **Bacterial Canker** - dark lesions with yellow halo, scattered pattern\n3. **Sooty Mould** - black coating, superficial appearance\n\nLet me view the reference images to compare:"
