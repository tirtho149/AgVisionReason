The reference images show more severe browning and larger lesions than what I see in test_014.\n\n2. **Bacterial_Canker** (Bacterial_Canker_001): Shows dark spots with yellow halos and angular shapes. The test_014 image does not show prominent yellow halos around the spots.\n\n3. **Sooty_Mould** (Sooty_Mould_001): Shows a dark coating or smudging on the leaf surface. This matches the appearance in test_014 - small dark speckles scattered across a green leaf, giving a \"dirty\" or \"dusty\" appearance.\n\n4. **Gall_Midge** (Gall_Midge_001): Shows raised bump-like galls that are 3D and cast shadows. The spots in test_014 appear flat, not raised bumps.\n\nThe target image best matches **Sooty_Mould** - it shows multiple small dark speckles distributed across a green leaf surface, creating a superficial dirty/dusty appearance characteristic of sooty mould.\n\n```json\n{\"prediction\": \"Sooty_Mould\"}\n```",
