Now let me analyze the key features:\n\n**Target Image Analysis:**\n- The leaf has dark brown/reddish spots scattered across it\n- The spots appear to have distinct boundaries\n- There's discoloration with what looks like necrotic tissue\n- The spots seem somewhat angular/irregular in shape\n- The overall condition suggests a disease rather than mechanical damage\n\nBased on the symptom descriptions, my top candidates are:\n1. **Bacterial_Canker** - dark brown/black lesions with yellow halo, scattered pattern\n2. **Anthracnose** - dark brown lesions with yellow halo, coalescing patterns\n3. **Die_Back** - tip necrosis with brown patches\n\nLet me examine reference images for these top candidates to make an informed decision:"
