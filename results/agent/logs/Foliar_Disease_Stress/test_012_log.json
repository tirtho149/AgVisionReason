The overall appearance suggests chlorosis (yellowing) with some vein-based damage progression.\n\n**Comparison with Reference Images:**\n\n1. **Anthracnose** (Anthracnose_001, Anthracnose_002): Shows dark brown to black irregular lesions with necrotic tissue and yellow halos. This is much more severe with distinct dark spots and coalescing lesions - NOT matching the target.\n\n2. **Bacterial_Canker** (Bacterial_Canker_001, Bacterial_Canker_002): Shows dark brown/black water-soaked lesions with yellow halos and a scorched appearance with distinct spots. This shows more localized dark damage than the target.\n\n3. **Die_Back** (Die_Back_001, Die_Back_002): Shows progressive necrosis from leaf tips downward along the midrib, with dark brown patches and surrounding yellow/bronze coloration. Die_Back_002 especially shows the characteristic progression pattern with yellowing and browning that progresses along the veins/midrib.\n\n**Key Observation:**\nThe target image (test_012.jpg) displays:\n- Pale yellow-green coloration throughout\n- Subtle linear patterns suggesting vein/midrib progression\n- Progressive discoloration from certain areas\n- No distinct dark lesions or localized spots\n- Characteristic yellowing with browning progression\n\nThis pattern matches **Die_Back** disease, which is characterized by necrosis progressing along the midrib from leaf tips and surrounding yellowing/bronze coloration.\n\n```json\n{\"prediction\": \"Die_Back\"}\n```",
