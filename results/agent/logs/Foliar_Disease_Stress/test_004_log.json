The leaf has a relatively green background but with visible brown/dark damage along the margins.\n\nBased on the initial visual inspection, my top candidates are:\n1. **Anthracnose** - shows dark lesions with eaten-away margins\n2. **Bacterial Canker** - angular lesions with yellow halos\n3. **Sooty Mould** - dark coating on leaf surface\n\nLet me examine the reference images for these top candidates to make a more accurate comparison."
